Systematic review of dental health apps using MARS and IMS Functionality Score


Objective: The proliferation of mobile health (mHealth) applications presents new opportunities

for promoting oral hygiene and self-management. This study aims to evaluate the quality,

usability, and functional scope of consumer-facing dental health applications designed for

individuals aged 12 and above. Two validated assessment tools—the Mobile App Rating Scale

(MARS) and the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics Functionality Score—were employed

to conduct a structured analysis.



Methods: A systematic review of the Apple App Store and Google Play Store was performed

using keywords related to oral health. Inclusion criteria were apps targeting users over 12 years

old, in English, with a minimum user rating of 2.5, and updated within the last five years. A total

of 21 apps (10 iOS, 11 Android) met the eligibility requirements. Each app was independently

assessed by three reviewers using MARS and the IMS functionality framework.



Results: The median MARS score across all apps was 3.3/5, with 57% of apps scoring ≥3.0,

indicating general acceptability. Functionality received the highest average sub score (≈4.0),

while information quality was rated lowest (≈3.0). All apps provided basic information and data

display features, but only 19% supported provider communication, and 28% included

personalized guidance or behavioral feedback.



Conclusions: Although dental health apps demonstrate strong functionality and user-friendly

design, significant gaps exist in personalized engagement, educational depth, and communication

features. Future app development should emphasize evidence-based content, user-specific

customization, and clinical relevance to better support public oral health outcomes.
