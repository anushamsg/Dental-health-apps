Introduction 
Mobile health (mHealth) applications have gained significant attention as tools for promoting self-management across various health domains, including oral health. Common oral diseases such as dental caries and periodontal disease are largely preventable with consistent daily hygiene practices. mHealth apps offer a promising platform to support and reinforce these behaviors. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the quality and functionality of consumer-facing dental health applications using two established evaluation frameworks: the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) and the IMS Institute functionality criteria.
Methods 
A systematic search of the Apple App Store and Google Play Store was conducted using a set of oral health related keywords, resulting in the identification of 496 apps from the Apple platform and 199from Google Play. The search aimed to identify consumer-facing apps focused on promoting oral health behaviors. Inclusion criteria required apps to (1) be available in English, (2) target the public (not providers), (3) contain core functionalities related to oral hygiene education or brushing behavior, and (4) be accessible for free or with limited in-app purchases. Duplicates and non-health-related apps were excluded. After initial screening, a final list of 21 apps meeting the criteria was selected for in-depth evaluation using the MARS framework and IMS functionality criteria. Three reviewers independently scored each app. Interrater reliability was strong (ICC = 0.962; 95% CI: 0.920–0.980).
Results
The median MARS score across the apps evaluated was 3.3 out of 5, suggesting moderate overall quality. Notably, 57% of the apps met or exceeded the minimum acceptability threshold (≥3.0), indicating potential for effective use in oral health promotion. Among the four MARS domains, functionality received the highest average rating (approximately 4.0), followed by aesthetics and engagement, while information quality scored the lowest (approximately 3.0), highlighting gaps in content accuracy and comprehensiveness. IMS functionality analysis revealed that features like display (100%) and inform (95%) were commonly present, whereas only 28% of apps offered personalized feedback and just 19% supported communication features. Top-performing apps such as Dental 3D Illustrations and Brush DJ stood out for their interactive content, user-friendly interfaces, and effective tracking tools. 
Discussion and Conclusions 
Our findings support and build upon those of Brooks et al. (2018), who observed limited theoretical grounding and suboptimal usability in many oral health apps. While our MARS-based evaluation similarly revealed inconsistencies in engagement and aesthetics, we observed improved functionality and broader feature integration. Unlike prior studies, our dual-framework approach—combining MARS with IMS functionality criteria—allowed us to assess both quality and behavioral support features. High-performing apps demonstrated strong interactive design but still lacked personalized feedback and clinical alignment. These findings highlight the ongoing need for dental app development to incorporate behavior change principles, validated content, and user-centered strategies. Future work should emphasize real-world testing and outcomes to enhance long-term engagement and effectiveness
